# bamazon_app

Welcome to Bamazon, the MySQL and Javascript Shopping Experience you were looking for!
TO BEGIN:
1. Run application through node.js in terminal. User is shown list of product for sale, populated by the database "bamazon_db" from mysql.
2. The user is then prompted to select a product to buy, indicated by the ID# of the left hand of the table.
3. Once the user has successfully selected a product, they are then prompted to input the quantity of that item that they wish to buy. It will not except anything except a number. If the items are in stock, the application gives the customer a total cost and subtracts the quantity of items bought from the stock total stored in the database, reflecting how many of that item is left to sell.
4. If the item is not in stock or the user tries to buy more than is available, they are told that there is insufficient stock.
